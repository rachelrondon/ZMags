# Hacker News: Ten of The Top Stories

This application provides a list of ten of the top Hacker News stories. The ten stories are randomly pulled from the Hacker News Top Stories API. The stories are listed in ascending order based on the storie's score. The Hacker News logo acts as a refresh button and a new list of 10 randomized stories will display when the Hacker News logo is pressed.

## Getting Started

Deployment Instructions:
git clone https://github.com/rachelrondon/ZMags.git
npm install

### Testing

I utilized the Sinon.JS (http://sinonjs.org/) unit testing framework to write tests for this application. I decided on this framework because I was able to find a lot of resources that showed that Sinon.JS is a great tool to test asynchronous functions. In addition to the documentation, I also reviewed the tutorial posted by Josh Newman on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09Lig2mlZS0).

I have written three basic tests for this application. At the time of submission, I have been troubleshooting babel transpiler issues and I have been unable to run the tests. Once these issues are resolved I would like to build out the tests for this application further.
